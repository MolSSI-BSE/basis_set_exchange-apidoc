Basis Set Exchange - REST API Documentation
===========================================

This documentation is for accessing the Basis Set Exchange via
the public REST API. For the web interface, visit
https://www.basissetexchange.org


The public API is currently in beta testing. I am not planning on changing api endpoints, but cannot
guarantee it at the moment.

If you are interested in heavy use of the public API, then feel free to contact me.
