## WARNING

The public API is currently in beta testing. I am not planning on changing api endpoints, but cannot
guarantee it at the moment.

If you are interested in heavy use of the public API, then feel free to contact me.


## Overview

This project aims to document the REST API of the Basis Set Exchange. Examples
are also included in this repository.
